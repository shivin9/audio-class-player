# Private Repository Deployment Guide

## Recommended Approach: Private Repo + Netlify

### Step 1: Create Private GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub → New Repository
2. Name: `audio-class-player`
3. ✅ Set to **Private**
4. Create repository

### Step 2: Upload Your Files
```bash
# Command line method:
cd /Users/shivin/Desktop/agora-app-builder/scheduled-audio-player
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial private audio player"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/audio-class-player.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify (Free)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub account
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Choose "GitHub" → Authorize Netlify
5. Select your private repo: `audio-class-player`
6. Deploy settings:
   - **Build command**: (leave empty)
   - **Publish directory**: `/` (root)
   - **Site name**: Choose custom name or use generated
7. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 4: Get Your URL
Netlify will provide a URL like:
```
https://your-site-name.netlify.app
```

### Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)
- In Netlify dashboard → Domain settings
- Add custom domain if you have one
- Or use the provided netlify.app subdomain

## Alternative: Vercel Deployment

### Quick Vercel Setup:
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. "Import Project" → GitHub
3. Select private repository
4. Deploy (no configuration needed)
5. Get URL: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

## Benefits of This Approach:
- ✅ **Code stays private** on GitHub
- ✅ **Free hosting** with Netlify/Vercel
- ✅ **Automatic deployments** when you update code
- ✅ **Custom domains** supported
- ✅ **HTTPS enabled** by default
- ✅ **Global CDN** for fast loading

## Security Considerations:
- Your **source code** remains private
- The **deployed website** is publicly accessible (which you want for students)
- **Audio files and schedule** are still protected by the built-in security features
- Students can access the player but cannot download audio or see your code

## Updating Your Classes:
1. Edit `config.js` in your private repo
2. Commit and push changes
3. Netlify/Vercel automatically redeploys
4. Students see updated schedule within minutes
